👋 Hello! I'm C++ developer 🔨, mechanical & electronic designer ⚡.

I'm using:
* C++ (gcc, clang)
* Windows/Linux

My pet-project is scanning old photos with a digital camera (digitization). I'm using custom DCP-profile created with dcamprof & ColorChecker24. If photo is warped, it can be dewarped with [dewarp_chessboard](https://github.com/dm-u/dewarp_chessboard).
